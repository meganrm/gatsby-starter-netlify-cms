subtitle: The Frontline Stories project uplifts and spotlights the human element
  at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic. It puts everyday individuals most
  directly impacted by the crisis—medical staff, essential workers, the
  economically displaced, patients and their families—at the forefront of the
  conversation.
description: In sharing our stories, we are giving voice to the need for a
  people-centered response. We are joining together to demand and mobilize for
  change that serves us, the people at the front lines.
