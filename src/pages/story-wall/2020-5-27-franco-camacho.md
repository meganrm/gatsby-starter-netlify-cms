My mother, a home health aide, my father, a stocker, and me a CSA, are minimum wage "essential workers" who expose ourselves everyday. I work as a Customer Service Associate at a local retail/pharmacy store, and unlike other pharmacies, mine didn't increased our pay or gave us more benefits, they just gave us a small $150 bonus, but only a month and a half after the pandemic started.
They gave us cheap face masks and gloves, but only after they were forced to do so, by the local government. Even though there is a pandemic going on, customers are still horrible and treat us terribly. On the positive side, public transportation is now free, and they made it mandatory for everyone to wear masks, but no one was hired to enforce the face mask policy at the buses. Also, billionaires are getting richer, and every week, people on unemployment are making A LOT more money than me.
