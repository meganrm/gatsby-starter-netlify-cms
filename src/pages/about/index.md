The goal of **Frontline Stories** is to center and uplift as many stories as possible from Americans most affected by the coronavirus pandemic—essential workers, the economically displaced, patients and their families—in order to shed light on the federal government's failure to respond adequately to this crisis.

[Town Hall Project](https://townhallproject.com/) has collected hundreds of public social media posts from Americans at the front lines. If you would like to submit a story, use our **[Submission Form](/contact)**. If you would like us to remove your story or contact us for other reasons email [info@townhallproject.com](mailto:info@townhallproject.com).
