The goal of **Frontline Stories** is to center and uplift as many stories as possible from those most affected by the coronavirus pandemic—essential workers, the economically displaced, patients and their families—in order to shed light on the federal government's failure to respond adequately to this crisis.

Frontline Stories, <a href="https://townhallproject.com/" target="_blank">Town Hall Project</a>, and our partners have collected hundreds stories from social media -- from people at the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis. If you would like to submit a story, use our **[Submission Form](/contact)**. If you would like us to remove your story or contact us for other reasons please email [info@townhallproject.com](mailto:info@townhallproject.com).
